Balex Institute Course Enrollment System

This repository contains a simple Java application for the Balex Institute's course enrollment system. The application prompts the applicant to input a `CourseID`, and the details of the course are returned to the screen. If an incorrect `CourseID` is entered, the system returns "Wrong CourseID details".

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Java class, `Courses`, which represents a course at the Balex Institute. Each `Courses` object has a course name, a course ID, and tuition.

The `Courses` class includes a `main` method that creates an array of `Courses` objects, prompts the user to enter a `CourseID`, and displays the details of the corresponding course.
